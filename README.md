This is a very simple search plugin using the WP Rest API used on http://www.webdesignermall.com. This project is open to contributors who would like to add any modern utilities to it with NodeJS, SASS, AngulaJS, etc.

Detailed instructions on developing this simple plugin are part of the Udemy course at Complete WordPress Theme Developer Course With WP REST API at https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-wordpress-theme-developer-course/

TO SET UP THIS PLUGIN: 

1. Install the plugin as you would any other WordPress plugin.
2. Open the wp-content/plugins/wp-rest-api-search/qs_wpapi.js file and change the home_url variable to your own domain name (around line 8).

ADDING THE SEARCH FORM

1. Create a new post, page, or text widget and add the [quick-search-form] shortcode, which is located in the plugin.

THAT'S IT!

You can test out the form by entering any keyword and pressing enter.
